In this demo, I created a neural network with TensorFlow framework to classify the raster background image based on the Archimedean Spiral points data (7 values of each point are inputted in the NN: x, y, x^2, y^2, xy, sin(x) and sin(y)) we inputed to the NN as training data.

The idea is from the Neural Network Playground demo created by Google: http://playground.tensorflow.org/ I might use a different approach compared to their demo.

Python Version needed: Python 3.5+
